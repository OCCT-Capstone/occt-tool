  pass: "Default inbound action is Block on Domain, Private, and Public."

  remediation: >
    Set default inbound to Block for all profiles:
    `Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Private,Public -DefaultInboundAction Block`.
    Then verify: `Get-NetFirewallProfile | Select Name,DefaultInboundAction`.

  pass: "Windows Defender Firewall is enabled on all profiles."
  fail: "Firewall is disabled on one or more profiles."
  remediation: >
    Enable firewall for all profiles:

    - SMB: remove custom 139/445 allows; keep File/Printer Sharing off on Public.
