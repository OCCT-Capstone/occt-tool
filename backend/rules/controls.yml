  title: "Password: Complexity Enabled"
  category: Account
  severity: high
  when: "win.password.complexity_enabled == True"

  pass: "Default inbound action is Block on Domain, Private, and Public."

  remediation: >
    Set default inbound to Block for all profiles:

  fail: "Firewall is disabled on one or more profiles."
  remediation: >
    Enable firewall for all profiles:

    Remove or scope inbound allow rules on Public:

    - SMB: remove custom 139/445 allows; keep File/Printer Sharing off on Public.
    - WinRM: `Disable-NetFirewallRule -Name *WINRM*` or restrict to Domain/Private.
    Prefer scoping to trusted subnets and to Domain/Private profiles.

    Add explicit block rules for unwanted services/ports (e.g., legacy protocols),
